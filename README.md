# Citi_Bike_activity_2023
Module 18 HW (Tableau) visualizations 
This analysis focuses on Citi Bike usage patterns. Upon gathering and analyzing the data, I observed that the highest level of activity occurred during the summer months, with a notable ride duration of 17 hours recorded on June 15th, alongside a significant spike in usage. The bike stations are strategically located in the heart of downtown, facilitating a healthier and more efficient way for commuters to navigate the city.

The data also reveals that Citi Bike members use the service more frequently than casual riders, though the difference is not as substantial as one might expect. Drawing from my experience living in Chicago, I have noticed similar patterns with our bike-sharing system, where tourists are frequent users, and locals sometimes leave bike stations empty due to high demand.

This dashboard provides an overview of station locations, ride types, popular days and times, as well as the duration of rides, offering a comprehensive view of Citi Bike activity.
